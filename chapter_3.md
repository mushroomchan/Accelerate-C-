Because median value can divide the set into two part equal with each other and it depends on every value in the set, if we disgard any value of the set that will change the position of the middle point. 

Here is an example. If we want to disgard the 5th bigger value and if we have totally 9 numbers in the set, then we disgard the median value we need.
